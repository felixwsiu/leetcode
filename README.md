Repo for LeetCode solutions in Python :) 

Notes:
  Sort vs Sorted: Sort directly modifies the list, Sorted will create a new list with the given parameter
  Sets vs Lists: Sets are fast for checking contains, Lists faster for iteration and when order matters of course
  Enumerate(iterable,start): Adds a counter to the iterable, useful for doing a foreach but needs access to an index as well eg. for index,num in enumerate(list)
  return[ i+5 for i in nums ]: Returns the output of each iteration as an entry in a list
  i[5],i[3] = i[3],i[5]: Used to swap elements of a list
